# ASAHW6-ChangeOfMeasure

This project contains only one file. 

What it is doing is to generate the process Xt = sqrt(c) Wt.

This is achieved by generating dWt --- independent Guassian, and integrate on dWt to get W. Then, compute sqrt(c) W.

In the function, we can set the initial state, stopping time T. 

The algorithm will plot the distribution of Xt and print p(c) = prob(X_1 > 1).
